      <p class="c_paragraph"><span class="head">C++</span><br>Like many, The good old C++ was my first programming language. I chose it in order to be
        fairly comfortable in basic and object-oriented programming which I am told serves as a robust base for a succesfull career in programming.
        I have learnt it well and I asses my c++ skills regularly on coding websites.</p>

        Followed by c++ I started to learn python. The basics were a bit on the easy side because of the previous language. When I finished basics of python I was fully into python
        untill that time I was convinced that this was the language which I wanted for my future. Because for doing small tasks I have to only write few
        line of code other then c++ in which I have to write a lot.

        UNIX based operating systems are addictive. It gives you entire control in your hand. From customization to permission you can precisely do anything. Along with web dev I am also learning to operate the entire

            moment. This is the line which I chased for all my pictures as all the pictures which I have captured till date I followed the same approach. I started taking pictures when I was 15 when my elder brother got his first mobile. It was nothing new
            whenever someone in your family gets his first mobile phone everyone in the family use it and mostly brothers or sisters. From his first mobile phone to my current mobile the habit still
            continues. I am not a professional photographer it is just one of my hobbies. Below are some of my snaps. </p>
